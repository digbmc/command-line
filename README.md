# Introduction to the Command Line

In this tutorial we're going to explore how to navigate your computer using the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (OSX) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.

In this session, we will:

- learn common commands to create and display files (`touch` and `echo`)
- learn commands to create directories (`mkdir`)
- navigate our file structure using change directory (`cd`), print working directory (`pwd`), and list (`ls`)
- move content from one place to another using redirects (`>`) and pipes (`|`)
- explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`
- search text files using the `grep` command
- create and sort cheat sheets for the commands we learn
